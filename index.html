    <P>&nbsp;</P>
    <P>We are all of us learning and, in seeking better answers, we learn to ask better questions. The topics here have arrived,
        somewhat serendipitously, in response to some of that deeper questioning...</P>

  <H2>Germanische Heilkunde</H2>
    <P>The discoveries of Dr Hamer turn our established view on medicine and illness on their head, allowing us to understand the cause and effect of all so-called diseases.
        This is the most important knowledge you can acquire to help navigate your life and your health and the inextricable link between your health and the circumstances,
        relationships and perception of them.</P>

  <H2>Prison Planet</H2>
    <P>What is it that all religions, especially the New Age (but also atheism/scientism) are distracting us from? Earth is a "loosh farm", prison within a prison for souls tricked into consenting to coming back via the false tunnel of light through the process of "reincarnation" (reincarceration), sometimes through the BS deception of "karma". The astral realm is similarly a prison, recycling souls into meat suits. When you die, you enter a personalised pantomime where you are greeted by fake jesus, your dead mother, whoever you will blindly follow through the tunnel and be tricked into going around the hamster wheel yet another time. It's very possible that the AI/Transhumanist agenda is rooted in the archons' plan to close the gates of the prison forever, from which immortal souls would no longer be able to "escape". Our essence is as an Immortal Soul, a holographic version of the Prime Eternal Creator. There is no saviour, nor do we need one as we have, if only we could fully integrate it, everything we need to secure our eternal freedom (and we have to make the most of this simulation while we are here).<P>
